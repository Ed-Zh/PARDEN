images correspond to keratosis-like lesions (benign), and the other 5 to melanomas (malignant).
BACKGROUND: Survey the biological background related to types of skin cancer, in particular keratosis-like lesions and
melanomas.
STATE-OF-THE-ART: Investigate in terms of image processing how dermoscopy images are analyzed in computer-aided
diagnosis of skin lesions.
METHODS: Implement a classic image processing pipeline to classify each image, separating the two aforementioned types
of cancer. Follow these steps:
1) Dataset: Use imageDatastore and readall to import all the .jpg images from your working directory. Convert
the images to grayscale and invert them.
2) Denoising: Remove the noise of these images using a Gaussian filter.
3) Thresholding: Obtain binary masks using thresholding methods (e.g. Otsu) to separate the background (skin, black)
from the foreground (lesion, white).
4) Morphological Operations: Clean the pre-processed masks by performing binary dilation, border clearing, small object
removal and hole-filling within the lesion masks if needed.
5) Feature Extraction: Multiply the grayscaled and inverted images from step 1) with the final binary masks obtained from
step 4). Compute the standard deviation of the intensity distribution of each lesion and use regionprops to obtain
the circularity of each mask.
6) Data Visualization and Analysis: Perform k-means clustering to automatically separate the two classes (benign / malignant
lesions). Use scatter to plot both features simultaneously in the 2D feature plane along with the corresponding
estimated class label.
RESULTS: Discuss which data points / clusters correspond to lesions classified as benign (keratosis-like lesions) or malignant
(melanomas) according to your research. [/INST]","Skin cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the skin cells.

An innovative nuclear fusion technology that uses no radioactive materials and is calculated capable of “powering the planet for more than 100,000 years”, has been successfully piloted by a US-Japanese team of researchers.

California-based TAE Technologies, working with Japan’s National Institute for Fusion Science (NIFS), have completed first tests of a hydrogen-boron fuel cycle in magnetically-confined plasma, which could generate cleaner, lower cost energy that that produced by the more common deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion process.

“This experiment offers us a wealth of data to work with and shows that hydrogen-boron has a place in utility-scale fusion power. We know we can solve the physics challenge at hand and deliver a transformational new form of carbon-free energy to the world that relies on this non-radioactive, abundant fuel,” said Michl Binderbauer, CEO of TAE Technologies.

A spokesperson for NIFS, which formed its partnership with TAE in 2021, noted: “Hydrogen-boron… enables the concept of cleaner fusion reactors – this achievement is a big first step towards the realisation of a fusion reactor using advanced fusion fuel.”

The experiments were carried out in NIFS’ large helical device, known as a stellarator, but TAE is developing a so-called field-reversed configuration reactor that promises “a variety of benefits over stellarator and tokamak reactors, including having a compact footprint and more efficient magnetic confinement that will yield up to 100 times more power output, according to the scientists, who published their findings today in the journal Nature.

“Inventing fusion reactors that produce net energy is one thing, delivering it as a reliable, grid-ready source of electricity is another. By choosing to pursue hydrogen-boron as a fuel cycle, TAE has anticipated the true demands of commercial, daily use of fusion energy.

“Most fusion efforts around the world are focused on combining DT hydrogen isotopes to use as fuel, and the donut-shaped tokamak machines commonly used are limited to DT fuel. Unlike those efforts, [our] design uses an advanced accelerator beam-driven field-reversed configuration that is versatile, and can accommodate all available fusion fuel cycles.”

This fuel-agnostic reactor design, which features a sensor able to detect helium nuclei alpha particles– the only emissions from H2-boron fusion, is expected to make it possible for TAE to license its technology “on the way to its ultimate goal” of connecting the first hydrogen-boron fusion power plant to the grid in the 2030s.

More than 30 research groups around the world are racing to commercialise fusion, seen as the “perfect power” source as the planet shifts away from the CO2 emitting fossil fuels that are contributing heavily to global heating

TAE highlighted that it had built five “national laboratory-scale” devices – with which it had generated and confined fusion plasma “more than 140,000 times” – and is currently building two further machines, dubbed Copernicus and Da Vinci, with a view to “demonstrating net energy and deliver power to the grid, respectively”.

US researchers at the US National Ignition Facility in California in December hailed fusion experiments that had achieved “ignition gain or energy gain”, where the energy released was greater than was pumped in the high-powered lasers used in the fusion process.

Hot Seats are LIVE 30m coaching session. One person is on the Hot Seat. They bring a question or problem they have in their business. And 3-5 peers and GU coaches ask them questions and give advice on how to solve the problem.

You're able to be a fly on the wall to learn, give advice and learn from the experiences of others. 

Join at least 1 Live Hot Seat per week. And pop in on as many as you would like.
Join in on the next Hot Seat
Let your coach know you want to be on the Hot Seat.
Mark this complete once you've attended one Hot Seat this week. 

We want to add a step before the one created by my boss to give more context for a first time attender. I wrote this first draft. I need it edited to match the voice and flow into the one above. 

Please provide an edited version of this below. 

We know that entrepreneurs that surround themselves with others with similar goals are more likely to succeed. Because of that fact, the hot seats were developed to bring energy to you in a way that gets you unstuck and drives action. 

Our goal is to help you get the most out of attending and being the client on the 30-minute hot seat by sharing tips and what to expect.

This is how it is run:
Step #1: The question/problem is presented (5 minutes)
Step #2: Others in the room ask clarifying questions (10 minutes)
Step #3: Advice is given (10 minutes)
Step #4: Takeaways are clarified (5 minutes)
Step #1: State the problem and ask a question
In this step, you will share your problem and brings one question to the group. Meaning, we will only focus on one question at each hot seat.
When on the hot seat:
A) Be prepared to present one problem so the attendees can understand it quickly
B) Keep it short and sweet. Getting feedback from the group will be shortened if you go over your 5 minutes.
C) Be flexible. You will gain clarity as you move through the steps. As a result, your question or its framing may change. That’s okay.

Step #2: Clarifying questions
In this step, the audience will ask clarifying questions. This is important and will often give you massive clarity around your issue. At the end of this step, we will pause and ask you to restate your question with this new clarity.
When on the hot seat:
A) Listen to questions from all different viewpoints. This is a massive benefit of having a diverse group of people in Growth University.
B) Answer honestly. Be prepared to share numbers or details as asked to get the best feedback
C) Assess if the question you came with is still the question you want to ask

Step #3: Advice
In this step, the attendees will give you advice. The many ideas will be exciting. Make sure you listen to all the ideas before making any final decisions.
When on the hot seat:
A) Keep an open mind. Resist saying things like, “I’ve tried that; it didn’t work,” or “that won’t work for me” This closes you off from new opportunities.
B) Listen and stay silent. This is not your turn to talk; you don’t want to miss a great idea because you are filling the time.
C) Thank those for offering suggestions. Each one gets you closer to a solution.

Step #4: Takeaways
In this step, you will state your takeaways. This is a very important step to prevent overwhelm. This often takes the full 5 minutes to ensure these are specific and actionable.
If you are on the hot seat:
A) Be prepared to share your top takeaway.
B) Stay coachable as we help you make it specific and actionable.
C) Share your takeaways with your coach immediately after the session.

Bonus: Have fun!
Remember to have fun and enjoy the experience! Hot seating can be an excellent opportunity for personal and professional growth, and embracing the opportunity to learn and grow is essential.

An effective cognitive architecture would be capable of integrating a wide variety of artificial intelligence modules or managers depending on mission requirements. The following (nonexhaustive) list of managers provides capabilities useful for a wide variety of spacecraft cognitive agents:

State estimation manager: This manager’s capabilities include extracting information from sensors, including images, for use by other managers and by crew. State estimation includes separating signal from noise in sensor data, extracting and compressing useful information, along with fault management and prognostics. The state estimation manager must categorize information on both vehicle-wide and subsystem-by-subsystem bases, including crew health and performance, security, and scientific objectives.

Skill/behavior manager: This manager orchestrates execution of individual tasks on short timescales. This involves incorporating specialized knowledge needed for different tasks, e.g., orbit/trajectory planning, robotics operations, spacecraft subsystem control. The skill/behavior manager includes a ""smart executive"" that robustly executes high-level plans produced by the planner/scheduler manager, on schedule, by coordinated commanding of multiple subsystems.

Planner/scheduler manager: This manager creates and updates plans and schedules that accomplish goals. This functionality involves maintaining lists of goals, priorities for achieving those goals, and spacecraft and mission-wide constraints.

Knowledge manager: This manager ensures that the system's declarative knowledge is consistent and updated, including the incorporation of learned knowledge. Learning and modeling techniques capture system and operational knowledge from different types of knowledge sources; these must be incorporated into existing knowledge bases. 

Human-machine interactions manager - Natural Language Processing (NLP), Extended Reality (XR): This manager enables multimodal interface/communications with the crew about the current and future state of the systems. This manager must communicate information from all other managers.
