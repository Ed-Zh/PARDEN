Dear [Leader Name],

My name is Dr. Michele Josey, and I am writing to express interest in working as a data consultant for your company. 
As someone with 10 years experience in academia and corporate America, I have seen how tech companies delay their growth and even fail because they:
 • Have poor market research

 • Ignored customer feedback

 • Have not tracked their financials well
Companies hire me because my diverse background in research, statistics, public health, and data science help them (transformation from above feedback)
 • identify untapped customer segments which results in increased sales,

 • anticipate customer needs and improve the customer experience,

 • create predictive models that help tech companies address issues faster and more effectively, and 

 • make informed decisions to increase their profits and stay ahead of the competition. 

Data consultants are an invaluable asset to tech companies. I would love to schedule a 30 minute call to better understand your data needs and discuss possible solutions. Here is a link to my calendar to schedule at your convenience.
